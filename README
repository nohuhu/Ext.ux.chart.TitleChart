Ext.ux.chart.TitleChart
======================

This class is an extension for Ext.chart.Chart that implements a titled
chart.

Usage is straightforward: in your source, replace 'chart' xtype with
'titlechart' and assign 'title' property. Other optional properties are:

    - titleLocation: 'left', 'right', 'top' or 'bottom'. Title text
      will be rotated accordingly when location is right or left.

    - titleFont: font properties for chart title, in CSS format.

    - titlePadding: space between chart canvas edge and title,
      in pixels.

    - titleMargin: space between title and actual chart area.

Note that this class is based on Ext.ux.chart.Chart class, which is
basically the same as Ext.chart.Chart except that some methods were
refactored for better reuse.

This extension is released under GPL 3.0 license, except for
Ext.ux.chart.Chart class which is provided as an example. Commercial
licensing is also available.
